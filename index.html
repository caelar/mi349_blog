            <h3>Solving for the Isolation Gap in Extended Reality Immersive Experiences</h3>

XR headsets provide an unparalleled immersive experience, but it is one that must be viewed in solitude. The very act of donning a headset and entering a virtual world inherently separates the user from those around them, creating a barrier to shared experiences and social interaction.</p>
        <p>Technologies like Meta's Horizons and Apple's Spatial Personas seek to bridge this divide, and I have been particularly impressed with the latter's ability to do so. By creating a sense of presence and connection within the virtual space, these solutions enable users to interact with digital representations of others in a more natural and engaging way. However, while innovations such as these are promising, they have yet to fully replicate the nuances and subtleties of face-to-face interaction that allow for truly communal experiences. </p>
        <p>In the meantime, while we await the development of these technologies, I would like to highlight a rather unexpected solution to this problem, one that eschews the limitations of the headset in favor of an inherently communal experience: The Las Vegas Sphere. This groundbreaking structure offers a glimpse into the future of shared immersive experiences, that must be seen to be truely undersood. I will be detailing a few noteworthy technologies created for the sphere as well as some of my thoughts on how it could influence the future of immersive entertainment and XR more broadly in a future post so stay tuned!</p>

        <p>In today's digital age, the ubiquity of photography has rendered many of the photos we take all but meaningless. But this was not always the case, not so long ago a photograph was something to be treasured. The time, dedication, and investment required to produce a photo inherently imbued it with a certain level of value and sentimentality. Though today this has all but been erased, replaced instead by an overwhelming abundance of often-forgotten digital images.</p>
        <p>This abundance has led to a situation where many of us rarely view or share the photos we take. Our digital libraries are filled with countless snapshots that we may never revisit, the sheer volume of images we amass making it difficult to appreciate each individually. </p>
        <p>But it is my belief that a return to film photography offers a solution to this problem allowing us to rediscover the value and sentimentality of photography. Through the intentionality, scarcity, and tangibility associated with film, we can create photographs that truly matter. Images that we will cherish and revisit for years to come, knowing that each one represents a carefully considered moment in time, preserved through the magic of light and chemistry.</p>
